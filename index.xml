      <description>This is a post about how R and Python communicates! First, I’ll just try something in python to see if it really works. Below just shows a simple function that displays # of days it has been since 12 a.m. 1/1/1970 GMT.
# Import the dataset import time total_seconds = time.time() print(&amp;#39;seconds since 12:00 am, 1/1/1970 GMT = &amp;#39;, total_seconds) ## seconds since 12:00 am, 1/1/1970 GMT = 1620639439.6569784 Now, to test out whether ‘reticulate’ really works to let R and python “talk” to one another, I’ll have R print out the number of days it has been using the result we’ve got from python shown above.</description>
